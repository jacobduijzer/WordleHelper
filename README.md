# Wordle Helper

Work in progress! I am trying to create an F# application to help me solve [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Inspired by a [post about solving](https://opensource.com/article/22/1/word-game-linux-command-line) it with the CLI. The basic, 5 character word list is created from the Arch Linux [words 2.1-6](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/words/) package.
